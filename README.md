# Machine-Learning Repository
**Author: Marcelo Guarido**

This is a tutorial in machine learning using self-created functions comparing the results with the Turicreate package. 

All examples are done using the Jupyter Notebook and the python 2.7. To use the Turicreate, it is required a Linux or MacOS system. For Windows 10, you can the WLS. To use the WLS in your windows 10, you can use this [tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/).

To install the Turicreate, please follow the instructions of this [link](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/).

## Machine Learning

In this machine learning tutorial, I am uploading the notebooks in different folders with the dataset used for the analysis. I will be uploading new codes as soon they are created and tested. Below is the list with the tutorials availables:

1. [Linear Regression](./Linear_Regression/Linear_Regression.ipynb)

This is just a tutorial with demonstrations of the usage of some machine learning algorithms and they are open source. I am not responsible for any bugs or errors if you decide to use them in your work and/or research.
